# Sample OLYMPICS DATA ANALYSIS FROM 1896 TO 2012

Here are my observations from the three datasets: I'm going to grouped the datasets into two, i.e

Summer Olympics
Winter Olympics
I have specifically analysed "SUMMER OLYMPICS".

CSV File:
dictionary.csv - This file contains Country, Code, Population and GDP per Capita.
summer.csv - This file contains all summer olympics games. (This contains the Summer Olympics Games database)
winter.csv - This file contains all winter olympics games.
